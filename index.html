        <h2>Presentation</h2>

        <p>
            Among the famous questions of "how much i spent on league" or "Is league of legends as good as arcane"
            You might have thought one day: "How do i do the biggest amount of Damage" or "What is the best build"<br/>
            
            Select your champion, your items and your target. League of damage will do the maths for you in order to know what's the best build.<br/>
            

            DISCLAIMER : having the best dps doesn't necessarly means that you're going to deal the biggest amount of damage, other parameters must be taken in account (zoning, healing, dps windows) <br>
            This tool is only here to give you the most optimal build against one target
